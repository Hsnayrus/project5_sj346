You can find the make and build commands in ./run.sh in the directory.
I tested all commands as we were directed to by the README. You can find a list of those commands in ./all_test.sh.
I tested all these commands in various vcm servers(around 4). I did 3 runs and in each run, I ran these commands thrice and they worked according to the specifiction.
